# DG's Speed Calculator

This is a speed calculator application I made to be able to calculate the speed of cars going by my house on my surveillance cameras. I decided to put it on my website and open source it as well.

## How to run and modify

Essentially clone this repo using git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dbob16/speed-calc
```

Then cd into it and run npm install:

```sh
cd speed-calc
npm install
```

You can make changes in the code in the src directory. If you want to spin up a dev server while doing it:

```sh
npm run dev
```

If you want to build it and put it on your own website, run the following:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then copy the contents of a dist folder onto your webserver/hosting provider/VPS, and link to it or src it on an iframe.

## Attribution

The code includes an attribution at the bottom. Even though this project is MIT licensed, meaning that you can legally remove it if you want to, I just politely ask you not to. Thank you.
